# This is a placeholder for the Farm Controller item texture
# In a real implementation, this would be a PNG image file
# The texture should be 16x16 pixels for the item icon
# 
# Texture description:
# - Miniature version of the block texture
# - Wood-like base with redstone circuits
# - Chest elements visible
# - Distinctive icon for inventory
#
# File should be saved as: /app/farm_automation_RP/textures/items/farm_controller.png
# 
# For now, this is a text placeholder that would need to be replaced
# with an actual PNG image file in a real Minecraft addon.
