# This is a placeholder for the Farm Controller block texture
# In a real implementation, this would be a PNG image file
# The texture should be 16x16 pixels for the block faces
# 
# Texture description:
# - Wood-like base texture similar to crafting table
# - Redstone circuit patterns on top
# - Chest-like elements on sides
# - Glowing elements to indicate automation
#
# File should be saved as: /app/farm_automation_RP/textures/blocks/farm_controller.png
# 
# For now, this is a text placeholder that would need to be replaced
# with an actual PNG image file in a real Minecraft addon.
